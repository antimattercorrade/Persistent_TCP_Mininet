1) To run the client, run `python3 tcp_client.py` command in the shell. It will ask for the number of books to download from
    the server. Input a value from 1-5. Then it will ask for a number corresponding to which will be the book to download. 
2) To run the server, run `python3 tcp_server.py` command in the shell.
3) After the input is received, client will connect to the server and download the respective books in "files_received" 
    folder.
4) The buffer size in the client and server can be set by changing the value corresponding to variable "BUFFER_SIZE" in 
    "tcp_client.py" and "tcp_server.py" files.
5) The client displays the connection setup time, calculated throughput and download time for each file 
    as well as the aggregate throughput and total download time in the prompt.
