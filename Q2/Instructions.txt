The directory structure is as follows:
    "Client" folder containing "tcp_client.py", "tcp_client_np.py" and "run_concurrent.sh". All downloaded files will be 
    stored in the "files_received" folder here.
    "Server" folder containing "tcp_server_sc_thread.py" and "tcp_server_sc_fork.py". 
    "novel" folder containing all five books.

////////////////////////////
//TCP Client/Server
///////////////////////////

1) To run the client, run `python3 tcp_client.py` command in the shell. It will ask for the number of books to download from
    the server. Input a value from 1-5. Then it will ask for a number corresponding to which will be the book to download. 
2) To run the fork model server, run `python3 tcp_server_sc_fork.py` command in the shell or to run the thread model server, 
    run `python3 tcp_server_sc_thread.py` command in the shell.
3) After the input is received, client will connect to the server and download the respective books in "files_received" 
    folder.
4) The buffer size in the client and server can be set by changing the value corresponding to variable "BUFFER_SIZE" in 
    "tcp_client.py" and "tcp_server_sc_thread.py" or "tcp_server_sc_fork.py" files.
5) The client displays the connection setup time, calculated throughput and download time for each file 
    as well as the aggregate throughput and total download time in the prompt.
6) To run the non persistent clients concurrently, run `./run_concurrent.sh` in bash or run `bash run_concurrent.sh` in any
    other terminal. It will start all the clients in background and print the output of all the clients.
