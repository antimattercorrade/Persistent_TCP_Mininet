## Custom Mininet Topology

- To run the scripts, run "sudo python3 part_<?>.py" where <?> is replaced by the respective part name, i.e k-m.

- The above command will create a mininet topology as specified in the script and run the server and client instances at the respective hosts.

- The output for all of the clients can be seen on the terminal after every client has finished downloading the file.

- The mininet network will then terminate after the above operation.
